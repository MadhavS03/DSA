worst case - O(n) -> a straight line which would be a linked list

O(log n) - BST
lookup() - O(log n)
insert() - O(log n)
remove() - O(log n)

Comparing with linked list :

Lookup:
BST is better as 
linked list lookup() -> O(n) - Iterating
BST lookup() -> O(log n)
 O(log n) better than O(n)

Remove:
BST is better as
Linked list -> O(n) - iterating then remove
BST -> O(log n)

Insert:
Linked list is better as
Linked list -> O(1) -> add in the end directly
BST -> O(log n)

Q - What would you choose if you need to add data to a data structure fast and retreival speed is not imp
    BST or Linked List?
A- Linked List is better here.
