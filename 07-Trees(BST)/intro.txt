Data structure in the form of a tree
can be seen as a linked list

Root node will point left right to other nodes

Binary tree - when one node only points to 2 other nodes
1 parent node - 2 child nodes

Full Tree - Every node point to either 2 or 0 nodes
Perfect Tree - Any level is completely filled all across
Complete Tree - When the tree is filled from left to right without gaps

Every node can only have 1 parent
child nodes can also be parent nodes

The node that doesn't have any children are - Leaf nodes

Binary Search Tree (BST):
If the value of the new node is greater than the parent node it will go in the right
If the value of the new node is lesser than the parent node it will go in the left
