Space complexity:

Adjacency Matrix-> O(|V|^2)
Adjacency List-> O(|V| + |E|)

V-vertices
E-edges

Time:

ADDING A VERTEX:

Adjacency Matrix-> O(|V|^2)
Adjacency List-> O(1)

ADDING AN EDGE:

Adjacency Matrix-> O(1) 
Adjacency List-> O(1)

REMOVING AN EDGE:

Adjacency Matrix-> O(1) 
Adjacency List-> O(|E|) (iterating through the edges list)

REMOVING A VERTEX:

Adjacency Matrix-> O(|V|^2) 
Adjacency List-> O(|V| + |E|)  (efficieny if you have a bidirectional list)

Adjacency List will be used for graphs
Adjacency Matrix also stores 0 where there is no edge 
not good for a bigger data
