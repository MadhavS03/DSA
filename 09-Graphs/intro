Contains verices(vertex) with edges(connection) between them.
no limit to how many other verices, a vertex can connect to
edges can also have weights 
can be directional or bi-directional

Trees are a form of graphs
-each node can only point to 2 other nodes

Linked List are a form of tree:
-can only point to one other node

Linked list is a form of graphs

Reprsenting in 2 ways:

Adjacency Matrix:
->bi directional
->can be weighted

Adjacency List:
->dicitonary 
->key value pair
-> key is vertex
   value is list of edges with the vertex(key)

Adjacency List is used for graphs
