For example Taking a address space from 0-7 which would be a list

Built in hash tables - Dictionary (Key-value pairs)
eg: {"nail": 1000}

How a hash table works:
-> has a hash function
-> Perform a hash on the key {"nails"}, run the key through the hash
-> we get an address with the key-value pair , eg: 2 - {"nail": 1000}
-> now we store the key-value pair to address 2
Also how a dictionary is stored

2 Hash characteristics:
-> One way only
-> Deterministic

Creating our :
own dictionary, 
own address space by creating a list

We can store more than one in one address space, but some conditions.
