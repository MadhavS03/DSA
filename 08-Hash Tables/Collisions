Collision happens when there is more than one key-value pair at an address.

how do we do that without over-writing last one?
both of them exist withing another list at the same address
-> This is called Separate Chaining

Another way to deal with it:
we put the new key-value pair at an empty address until we find it.
you don't have more than 1 key-value pair at one address
-> called Linear Probing (open addressing)

We can use linked list than a list in Separate chaining for dealing with collisions.
