FIFO
Enqueue - Add 
Dequeue - remove
ways to implement a Queue:
- in a List -> add on one end and remove on other end
            -> from one end adding and removing is O(1)
            -> from other end adding and removing is O(n)

- in a Linked List -> removing is O(n) from end
                   -> adding is O(n) from end
                   -> adding & removing is O(1) from start

Therefore Enqueue from end and Dequeue from start as both O(1)
