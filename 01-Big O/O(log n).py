### O(log n)
### Log comes in use when we have large number of operations, findinf numbers in list
### we can cut it in half repeatedly and can find any number in the list 
### 2^3 = 8
### log base 2 (3) = 8
### Similarly , log base 2 (1073741824) = 31
### O(log n)
### Very flat on graph close to O(1)

### O(n log n ) - Sorting algorithims
